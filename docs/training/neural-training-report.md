## Usage Examples

### Load and Use Trained Models

```bash
# Check model status
npx claude-flow@alpha neural status

# Load coordination model
npx claude-flow@alpha model load --path models/coordination_v1.model

# Run prediction
npx claude-flow@alpha neural predict --model-id model_prediction_1760909747334 --input "task-data"
```

### MCP Tool Integration

```javascript
// Retrieve trained models
mcp__claude -
  flow__memory_usage({
    action: 'retrieve',
    namespace: 'neural',
    key: 'trained_models',
  });

// Run inference
mcp__claude -
  flow__inference_run({
    modelId: 'model_prediction_1760909747334',
    data: [
      /* input data */
    ],
  });
```

## Training Configuration

```json
{
  "coordination": {
    "pattern_type": "coordination",
    "epochs": 50,
    "data_source": "recent_operations",
    "acceleration": "wasm-simd"
  },
  "optimization": {
    "pattern_type": "optimization",
    "epochs": 50,
    "data_source": "resource_allocation",
    "acceleration": "wasm-simd"
