The catalogue combines static metadata with the governance agent's nightly snapshot. Source data lives in
`docs/governance/cleanup-manifest.json` and is rendered into this section during build time.

## Active workflows

- **Proposal generation v2** – Coordinates retrieval, drafting, and validation agents.
- **Incremental portal scanning** – Schedules portal scans to identify new opportunities.
- **Compliance validation** – Runs legal and eligibility checks before submission.

## Under review

- **Legacy proposal summariser** – Candidate for archive; duplicated in multiple legacy docs.
- **Alternate scoring model** – Requires updated evaluation metrics and tests before re-enable.

## Migration timeline

| Week | Focus | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| W1 | Merge environment setup guides | Docs team |
| W2 | Consolidate optimisation reports | AI platform |
| W3 | Promote observability runbooks | DevOps |

Changes to workflow scope must be captured via `pnpm docs:changelog`.
