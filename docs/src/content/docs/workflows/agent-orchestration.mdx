## Execution layers

1. **Request intake** begins with Mastra orchestrators defined in `src/mastra/index.ts`.
2. **Tools & memory** leverage shared providers in `src/mastra/tools` and `src/mastra/memory`.
3. **Workflow runners** call out to Claude Code and GPT with prompt templates stored adjacent to each agent.

## Documentation sources

- Prompt rationale is captured inline in agent files using docblocks.
- Workflow diagrams and timing data will be centralised here as we migrate from the legacy backlog.
- TypeDoc ensures each exported workflow exposes parameters and expected outputs.

## Governance hooks

- Any new agent must reference an existing doc section or extend this page.
- Duplicate workflow summaries are rejected by the governance agent and merged into the canonical entry.
- For experiments, use the legacy backlog and mark with an expiry date.

Refer to the [workflow catalogue](./workflow-catalogue) for status tracking and cleanup actions.
