## Principles

- **One entry per merge.** Every merged PR must create or update a release section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Automation first.** The Doc Governance Agent parses git history, groups changes by scope, and inserts templated notes.
- **Signal over noise.** Refactors, dependency bumps, and typo fixes are ignored unless they include user-facing change.

## How the automation works

1. `pnpm docs:changelog -- --base origin/main` compares the feature branch with `origin/main`.
2. Changes are bucketed into _Code_, _Documentation_, _Infrastructure_, or _Operations_ based on file globs.
3. The script writes to `CHANGELOG.md` using keep-a-changelog format. New releases are dated automatically.

```bash
pnpm docs:changelog -- --base origin/main --release 2025.02.14
```

If the release flag is omitted, the script appends to an `Unreleased` section.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Entry lives under the correct release heading.
- [ ] Scope labels match files touched.
- [ ] Links to PR numbers or issues are added manually after merge.
