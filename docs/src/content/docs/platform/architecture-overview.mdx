The RFP Agent platform is a full-stack TypeScript system that blends deterministic services with adaptive AI orchestration.
This overview summarises the core subsystems so technical and operations documentation can reference a single source.

## Subsystems

| Subsystem | Location | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Client** | `client/src` | React + TanStack Query front-end, Storybook-documented components, proposal workflows |
| **Server** | `server/` | Express HTTP APIs, Drizzle ORM access layer, background job scheduling |
| **Shared** | `shared/` | Type-safe DTOs, validation schemas, utilities reused across client and server |
| **Mastra Workflows** | `src/mastra/` | Agent definitions, memory providers, workflow automation for proposal drafting |
| **Scripts** | `scripts/` | Operational tooling: migrations, testing harnesses, governance scripts |
| **Tests** | `tests/` | Jest suites, fixtures, Playwright integration |

## Data flow

1. Source RFP documents are ingested via the `server` service, persisted, and normalised.
2. Workflow triggers call into Mastra orchestrations which coordinate Claude Code, GPT, and other providers.
3. Shared types ensure parity between REST responses and UI consumption.
4. Observability integrates Sentry, structured logging, and correlation IDs described in the legacy documentation backlog.

## Documentation sources

- **TypeDoc** surfaces API-level signatures for each exported module.
- **Storybook** snapshots component usage and accessibility states.
- **Runbooks** and **Guides** are curated Markdown documents stored under `docs/src/content/docs`.
