The Doc Governance Agent parses every `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.md`, and `.mdx` file to maintain an up-to-date view of repository
coverage. The latest snapshot is committed to [`docs/governance/repo-audit-report.md`](../governance/repo-audit-report).

## Coverage summary

| Subsystem | Files | Key entry points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Server APIs** | `server/**/*.ts` | `server/index.ts`, `server/routes`, `server/services` |
| **Client UI** | `client/src/**/*.tsx` | `client/src/App.tsx`, `client/src/pages`, Storybook stories |
| **Shared contracts** | `shared/**/*.ts` | `shared/index.ts`, `shared/contracts`, `shared/schemas` |
| **Mastra orchestration** | `src/mastra/**/*.ts` | `src/mastra/index.ts`, agent definitions, tools, workflows |
| **Tests** | `tests/**/*.ts` | Jest integration suites, Playwright specs |
| **Documentation** | `docs/src/content/docs/**/*.mdx` | Governance, platform, workflows, operations |

## Duplicate candidates

The governance agent flagged the following duplicate or overlapping documents for consolidation. Status and owners are
tracked in the cleanup manifest.

- Multiple workflow guides under `docs/archive` describing similar incremental scanning routines.
- Parallel environment setup docs in `docs/guides/development-setup.md` and `docs/guides/environment-setup.md`.
- Redundant optimisation reports spread across `docs/optimization/` and `docs/analysis/`.

Consult the [cleanup roadmap](../legacy/cleanup-roadmap) for merge actions, staging owners, and deadlines.
