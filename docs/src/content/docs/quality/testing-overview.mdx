## Testing layers

| Layer | Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | `pnpm test` | Validate isolated logic in `server`, `shared`, and `src/mastra` |
| Integration | `pnpm test -- tests/integration` | Multi-service workflows and database checks |
| E2E | `pnpm playwright test` | Browser flows recorded for proposal submission |
| Agent | `pnpm test-agents` | Mastra workflow verification |

## Documentation policy

- All new testing strategies must update this page instead of creating standalone docs.
- The governance agent merges redundant testing guides into this canonical entry.
- Test data fixtures should link back to sections here for context.

## Reporting

- Coverage reports publish to the CI summary and are linked in the changelog when thresholds change.
- Regressions open an incident linked from [Observability & Runbooks](../operations/observability-runbooks).
