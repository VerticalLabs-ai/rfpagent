## Focus areas

- **API latency**: monitor p95 < 2s, ensure caching on expensive routes.
- **Workflow throughput**: parallelise agent steps where safe, avoid redundant retrieval calls.
- **Client rendering**: leverage suspense boundaries and memoization for heavy proposal tables.

## Consolidation targets

- Merge historical reports from `docs/optimization/` and `docs/analysis/` into this central document.
- Archive status updates older than 90 days to the legacy backlog.
- Prefer metrics pulled from observability dashboards over anecdotal improvements.

## Automation hooks

- Governance agent flags new optimisation docs and routes them to this page via pull request comment.
- TypeDoc reference ensures helper utilities (e.g. caching, batching) link here for implementation notes.
