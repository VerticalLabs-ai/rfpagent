# RFP Agent Documentation

Welcome to the consolidated documentation and changelog system for the RFP Agent platform. This site combines
automated API references, curated architecture guides, agent workflow explainers, and operations runbooks in one
versioned location.

<Callout type="note">
The Doc Governance Agent runs on every pull request to audit changes, merge duplicate files, and enforce
naming, metadata, and changelog policies.
</Callout>

## Why this hub exists

- **Stop doc sprawl.** Starlight provides a single publishing surface, while the governance agent rewrites or merges
  redundant Markdown during CI.
- **Stay accurate.** TypeDoc, Storybook metadata, and repository scans are re-generated on every merge.
- **Deliver fast onboarding.** Consistent navigation and categories mirror the architecture of the platform, so new
  contributors find the context they need without hunting across folders.

## Key automation pillars

1. **Typedoc pipeline** captures server, client, shared, and agent interfaces under `/reference/typedoc-index`.
2. **Doc Governance Agent** validates metadata, detects duplicates, and appends changelog entries.
3. **CI/CD workflows** run `pnpm docs:generate` and deploy the Starlight site to your chosen hosting target.
