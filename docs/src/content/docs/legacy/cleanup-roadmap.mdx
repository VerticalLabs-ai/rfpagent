The cleanup roadmap is generated from `docs/governance/cleanup-manifest.json`. It summarises actions for the next sprint.

## Priority merges

| Source files | Action | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `guides/development-setup.md`, `guides/environment-setup.md` | Merge | `src/content/docs/operations/dev-environment.mdx` (to be created) |
| `optimization/code-optimization-report.md`, `analysis/performance-review.md` | Merge | `quality/performance-optimization.mdx` |
| `technical/agents-architecture.md`, `technical/route-refactoring-guide.md` | Update | `workflows/agent-orchestration.mdx` |

## Archive candidates

- Status reports older than 2024 in `docs/archive/`
- One-off debugging notes under `docs/troubleshooting/`
- Session transcripts stored in dated folders within `docs/reviews/`

## Rewrite backlog

1. Update the PDF processing guide with new pipeline steps.
2. Replace `mastra-cloud-deployment.md` with deployment instructions inside Starlight.
3. Consolidate testing docs into the canonical testing overview page.

Progress is tracked by the governance agent and surfaced during CI runs.
