## Logging and metrics

- Application logs stream via Winston and Sentry (see legacy doc `technical/logging-and-observability.md`).
- Structured fields include `correlationId`, `requestId`, and agent identifiers for cross-trace analysis.
- Metrics exported to your APM solution should include workflow latency, success rates, and proposal throughput.

## Alerting thresholds

| Signal | Threshold | Runbook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workflow failure rate | > 5% in 10 minutes | Restart Mastra workflows, inspect queue backlog |
| API latency | > 2s p95 | Scale server pods, inspect DB indices |
| Proposal generation SLA | Missed 3+ tasks | Trigger manual review and notify customer success |

## Incident response

1. Confirm the alert in your observability dashboard.
2. Create an incident channel referencing the relevant workflow or subsystem.
3. Follow the per-signal runbook and capture remediation steps in the changelog.

## Documentation hooks

- When a runbook changes, update the [changelog discipline guide](../governance/changelog-discipline) and include the incident ID.
- For new metrics or dashboards, add a Storybook note or TypeDoc comment to the associated module for traceability.
