## Pipeline overview

1. **Install dependencies** with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
2. **Run checks**: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm test`, and the docs governance suite.
3. **Generate docs**: `pnpm docs:generate` builds TypeDoc output and the Starlight site.
4. **Deploy**: Artifacts sync to Netlify or Vercel depending on environment variables.

## Required secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DOCS_DEPLOY_TOKEN` | Deploy access token for Netlify/Vercel |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Required for changelog commits |
| `CI` | Set to `true` for pnpm to respect non-interactive mode |

## Command reference

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm docs:governance
pnpm docs:generate
```

## Hosting targets

- **Preview**: Deploy from pull requests to temporary environments.
- **Production**: Deploy from `main` after governance + changelog steps pass.

Read the [`docs-maintenance` workflow](../../../../.github/workflows/docs-maintenance.yml) for full job configuration.
