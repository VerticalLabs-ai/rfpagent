## Source of truth

- Storybook configuration: `client/.storybook`
- Component stories: `client/src/components/**/__stories__/*.stories.tsx`

## Documentation pipeline

1. Storybook emits JSON via `pnpm storybook:extract` (script to be added) which is consumed by the governance agent.
2. Components with `docs` parameters automatically link into this page.
3. Screenshots or visual regression diffs are attached to PRs and referenced in the changelog.

## Governance rules

- Component documentation should live with the story. The governance agent rejects Markdown duplicates.
- Use MDX in stories for long-form documentation; Starlight will ingest the output automatically.
