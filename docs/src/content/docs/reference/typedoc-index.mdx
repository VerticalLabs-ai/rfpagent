TypeDoc output is generated during `pnpm docs:typedoc` and published under `/generated/typedoc` at build time. Starlight
consumes the markdown output and exposes module pages within this section.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm docs:typedoc
```

## Coverage

| Package | Entry Point |
| --- | --- |
| Server | `server/index.ts` |
| Mastra workflows | `src/mastra/index.ts` |
| Shared types | `shared/index.ts` |
| Client bootstrap | `client/src/index.tsx` |

Entries appear in the sidebar after the generator runs; no manual edits required.
