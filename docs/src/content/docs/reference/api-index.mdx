## REST API

- Base URL: `https://api.rfpagent.example.com`
- Authentication: Bearer tokens issued via the 1Password-integrated secrets manager.
- OpenAPI spec: `docs/legacy/api/openapi.yaml` (scheduled to migrate into TypeDoc-backed reference pages).

## Typedoc integration

TypeDoc extracts route handler signatures, DTOs, and supporting utilities. See the [TypeDoc index](./typedoc-index) for
automatically generated content.

## Change process

- API changes must update this index rather than creating individual Markdown files.
- Governance agent blocks duplicate endpoint docs and rewrites links to the canonical section.
