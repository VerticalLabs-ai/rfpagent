# RFP Agent: Go-to-Market Strategy & Launch Plan

## Executive Summary

**Mission**: Become the dominant AI-powered government procurement automation platform by exploiting critical gaps in browser automation, end-to-end workflows, and government-specific features that competitors cannot match.

**Opportunity**: $10B market with no dominant automated solution. Current leaders focus on content management; we automate the entire lifecycle.

**Target**: $100M ARR by Year 5 with 20,000 customers through product-led growth and strategic enterprise sales.

We automate the entire RFP lifecycle - from portal discovery to automated submission - enabling government contractors to win 50% more contracts with 70% less effort.

### 1.2 Category Creation

**OLD CATEGORY**: RFP Response Management

- Manual content libraries

| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| "Manage your RFP content better" | "We write and submit proposals for you" | 10x productivity vs. 2x     |
| "Collaborate on proposals"       | "Let AI do the work while you approve"  | Automation vs. facilitation |
| "Enterprise-grade features"      | "Enterprise automation at SMB prices"   | Accessible vs. exclusive    |
| "AI-assisted writing"            | "Fully autonomous AI agents"            | Full automation vs. copilot |

## 10. RISK MITIGATION

### 10.1 Key Risks & Mitigation Strategies

**Risk 1: Low Product-Market Fit (PMF)**

- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: High (business fails)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Beta phase validates PMF before scaling
  - Weekly customer interviews for feedback
  - Pivot quickly if PMF not achieved in 90 days

**Risk 2: High Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**

- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium (unit economics break)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Focus on product-led growth (lower CAC)
  - Optimize conversion funnel continuously
  - Pause paid ads if CAC >$600

**Risk 3: Competitor Response (RFPIO adds automation)**

- **Probability**: Low-Medium (12-18 months)
- **Impact**: High (lose differentiation)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Move fast on FedRAMP certification (defensible moat)
  - Build deep portal integrations (switching cost)
  - Lock in customers with data network effects

**Risk 4: Portal Blocking/Rate Limiting**

- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium (automation breaks)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Human-in-loop workflows for 2FA
  - Respect robots.txt and rate limits
  - Legal review of terms of service
  - Proxy rotation and IP management

**Risk 5: Regulatory Compliance (FedRAMP delays)**

- **Probability**: High (slow process)
- **Impact**: Medium (limits enterprise sales)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start FedRAMP process early (Month 1)
  - Target non-federal customers initially
  - Partner with FedRAMP-authorized infrastructure

### 10.2 Contingency Plans

**If Beta Fails** (No PMF by Month 2):

- Pivot to specific portal (e.g., Bonfire only)
- Focus on single use case (discovery vs. full lifecycle)
- Interview 50 customers to find real pain point

**If CAC Too High** (>$800 by Month 4):

- Pause all paid acquisition
- Double down on organic/PLG
- Extend runway with cost cuts

**If Competitors Respond** (RFPIO launches automation):

- Accelerate FedRAMP certification
- Focus on government-specific features they can't match
- Compete on price (stay 5x cheaper)
