# RFP Agent: Market Executive Summary & Investment Thesis

## The Opportunity

**The $10B government procurement market has no dominant automated solution. We're building it.**

RFP Agent is the first AI-powered platform that automates the entire RFP lifecycle - from portal discovery to automated submission - enabling government contractors to win 50% more contracts with 70% less effort.

---

## Market Problem

### The Pain is Real

Government contractors waste **$10 billion annually** on manual RFP processes:

- **60 hours per proposal** (manual writing, compliance checking, form filling)
- **Missing opportunities** (can't monitor 50+ portals simultaneously)
- **Low win rates** (10-15% industry average)
- **High costs** (enterprise tools cost $50K-$200K/year)
- **Manual submission** (overnight FedEx, portal crashes, missed deadlines)

### Current "Solutions" Don't Solve It

**Enterprise Tools** (RFPIO, Loopio - $50K-$200K/year):
- ❌ Content management only - no automation
- ❌ Still requires 60+ hours of manual work
- ❌ No browser automation or portal integration
- ❌ Unaffordable for 90% of contractors

**Intelligence Tools** (GovWin, Procurement Sciences - $15K-$150K/year):
- ❌ Find opportunities but don't respond to them
- ❌ Research only - no proposal generation
- ❌ Manual workflows from discovery to submission

**Status Quo** (Word + Excel):
- ❌ 100% manual processes
- ❌ Error-prone, time-consuming
- ❌ Can't scale without hiring armies of proposal writers
