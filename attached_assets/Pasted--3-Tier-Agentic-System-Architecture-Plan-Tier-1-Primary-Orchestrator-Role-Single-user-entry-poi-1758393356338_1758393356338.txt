🏗️ 3-Tier Agentic System Architecture Plan
Tier 1: Primary Orchestrator
Role: Single user entry point and strategic coordinator

Responsibilities:
Maintains global strategy and session context
Decomposes user intents into structured WorkItems
Dispatches work to appropriate Manager agents
Arbitrates conflicts and handles escalations
Owns SLAs and overall workflow success
Tier 2: Manager Agents
Specialized domain coordinators with deep contextual knowledge:

Portal Manager - Coordinates portal-specific operations and scraping
Proposal Manager - Oversees proposal generation, compliance, and quality
Research Manager - Coordinates market research and competitive analysis
Compliance Manager - Ensures regulatory compliance across all activities
Workflow Manager - Manages complex multi-step workflow execution
Manager Responsibilities:

Maintain domain-specific playbooks and best practices
Select and coordinate Specialist agents based on capability and load
Quality gate outputs before handoff
Handle domain-specific error recovery and retries
Tier 3: Specialist Agents
Portal-Specific Agents (since each portal is unique):

Austin Finance Online Specialist - Tailored for Austin's portal structure
Bonfire Hub Specialist - Optimized for Bonfire's interface and data
FindRFP Specialist - Specialized for FindRFP's search patterns
Task-Specific Agents:

Document Analysis Specialist - PDF parsing and content extraction
Proposal Writer Specialist - Generates compliant proposal content
Compliance Checker Specialist - Validates requirements and regulations
Research Specialist - Market analysis and competitive intelligence
Submission Specialist - Handles portal submissions and follow-up
🔧 Core Implementation Components
1. Agent Registry & Capability Management
interface AgentCapability {
  id: string;
  tier: 'orchestrator' | 'manager' | 'specialist';
  role: string;
  capabilities: string[];
  tools: string[];
  maxConcurrency: number;
  status: 'active' | 'busy' | 'offline';
  lastHeartbeat: Date;
}
2. WorkItem Coordination Protocol
interface WorkItem {
  id: string;
  sessionId: string;
  contextRef: string; // rfpId/portalId/profileId
  taskType: string;
  inputs: any;
  expectedOutputs: string[];
  priority: number;
  deadline: Date;
  retries: number;
  assignedAgent?: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'assigned' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed';
}
3. Enhanced Context Management
Session-scoped working memory for active workflows
Persistent episodic logs for learning and debugging
Knowledge base for capabilities, templates, and learned patterns
Context packs with RFP/Portal/CompanyProfile linking for traceability
4. Communication Patterns
Orchestrator → Manager: High-level intent with session context
Manager → Specialist: Specific WorkItems with detailed instructions
Specialist → Manager: Structured results with confidence scores
Manager → Orchestrator: Aggregated results and status updates
📊 Enhanced Monitoring & Observability
Agent Cohort Dashboard
Tier Overview: Health status by agent tier
Agent Grid: Individual agent status, load, and performance
Session Timelines: WorkItem flow and coordination patterns
SLA Monitoring: Response times and success rates
Queue Depths: Backlog and bottleneck identification
Performance Metrics
Per-agent success rates and latency
Cross-agent coordination efficiency
Resource utilization and scaling needs
Portal-specific performance patterns
🚀 Implementation Strategy (3 Phases)
Phase 1: Foundation (Orchestrator + Registry)
Implement AgentRegistry with capability management
Create Primary Orchestrator agent
Establish WorkItem protocol and coordination
Add Agent Cohort UI to monitoring dashboard
Update existing workflows to route through Orchestrator
Phase 2: Manager Layer
Implement Portal Manager with 3 portal specialists
Create Proposal Manager for content generation
Add queue management and retry mechanisms
Implement capability-based routing
Add heartbeat monitoring and health checks
Phase 3: Advanced Features
Complete all Manager and Specialist agents
Implement advanced coordination patterns
Add predictive load balancing
Create agent performance optimization
Implement A/B testing for agent behaviors
🔐 Security & Isolation
Least-privilege tool access per agent
Portal credential isolation by specialist agent
Sandboxed browser automation for scraping
Comprehensive audit logs for all agent actions
💡 Key Benefits
Scalability: Horizontal scaling of specialist agents
Reliability: Fault tolerance through agent redundancy
Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns by domain
Performance: Parallel processing and load distribution
Observability: Comprehensive monitoring and debugging
Flexibility: Easy addition of new portals and capabilities
This architecture transforms your platform from a single-agent system into a sophisticated, scalable, and robust multi-agent platform that can handle complex RFP workflows efficiently while maintaining clear oversight and control.
